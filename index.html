                    <p>
                        I'm a high school student based in Bulgaria.
                        I'm passionate about building all types of applications and learning new technologies,
                        frameworks, and languages.
                        I'm currently studying System Programming and I'm always, looking for new opportunities to learn and
                        grow.
                        I'm also completely self-taught, so I'm planning to study a full-stack development
                        course in the near future as well as Computer Science.
                        I'm currently working on getting better at designing and building websites and applications.

                <p>
                    I'm also a big fan of serials, movies etc.
                    I listen to a lot of German rap as well as English rap, pop etc.
                    I also have a favorite hobby which would be programming and you guessed it gaming.
                    I spend most of my time watching youtube videos and I'm in love with the amount of content that
                    is available to me.
