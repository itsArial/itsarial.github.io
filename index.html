            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a high school student based in Bulgaria. I'm passionate about building all types of 
                applications and learning new technologies, frameworks, and languages. I'm currently studying
                System Programming and I'm always, looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                I'm also completely self-taught, so I'm planning to study a full-stack development course in the near
                future as well as Computer Science. I'm currently working on getting better at designing and building 
                websites and applications. <br> I'm also a big fan of serials, movies etc. I listen to a lot of German rap
                as well as English rap, pop etc. I also have a favorite hobby which would be programming and you guessed it gaming. 
                I spend most of my time watching youtube videos and I'm in love with the amount of content that is available to me. <br><br> </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently a final year high school student studying System Programming. I am a co-leading student in a few clubs which include
                Programming with C++, Reverse Engineering Club and a club for Programming with Arduino. I am intensively studying different types of 
                Computer Architectures, Integrated Systems, Data Bases, Network System, Development of Network Systems etc. a.k.a all the stuff studied
                in most Computer Science Bachelor degree programs in most universities. <br><br>
